# About Me | Systems Architect

**Name:** Kamal

**Role:** AI Systems Architect & Full Stack Engineer

**Project Context:**
This project, **CORTEX PRIME v3.0**, is a demonstration of high-end AI agent orchestration. It showcases the integration of multiple LLM providers (Mistral, Gemini) into a unified, resilient pipeline. 

**Key Achievements in this Build:**
-   **Resilient Fallback Architecture:** Engineered a multi-tier failover system (primary -> secondary -> mock) that gracefully handles API rate limits (common in free tiers).
-   **Enterprise Aesthetics:** Designed the "Deep Cosmos" theme, prioritizing a technical, high-contrast look suitable for enterprise-grade tools.
-   **Structured Intelligence:** Implemented Zod-based validation to ensure LLM outputs strictly follow JSON schemas for downstream processing.
-   **Operational Transparency:** Built real-time diagnostics and execution archives to provide full observability into the AI's decision-making process.

**Technical Mastery:**
-   **Next.js 14 / App Router:** Modern server/client component architecture.
-   **Tailwind CSS & Framer Motion:** High-fidelity UI design and fluid UX.
-   **TypeScript & Zod:** Type-safe development and data validation.
-   **Winston Logging:** Professional-grade observability.
