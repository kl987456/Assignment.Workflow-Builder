# Prompt History | CORTEX PRIME Evolution

This log tracks the command sequences that evolved a basic "Workflow Builder Lite" into the **CORTEX PRIME v3.0** agentic terminal.

## Phase 1: Foundation (v1.0)
> **Prompt Sequence:** Initial build focused on a functional Next.js 14 App Router setup with linear text processing and local JSON history.

## Phase 2: Design Shift (v2.0)
> **Prompt Sequence:** "Elevate the design to a Premium Dark Mode aesthetic. Use translucent backgrounds with backdrop blur (glassmorphism) and Framer Motion for a fluid, 'alive' feel."

## Phase 3: The CORTEX PRIME Upgrade (v3.0)
> **Prompt Sequence:** "Act as a Senior AI Architect. We need to pivot to a professional 'Enterprise Intelligence' aesthetic.
>
> 1. **Visual Refinement:** Rebrand renamed as 'CORTEX PRIME'. Use a 'Deep Cosmos' palette (Navy/Indigo) with technical grid backgrounds. Implement an IDE-style 3-column layout.
> 2. **Expansion:** Add two new high-level agents:
>    -   'Operations Manager' for Action Item extraction.
>    -   'Communications Director' for professional text polishing.
> 3. **Observability:** Integrate duration telemetry (ms) into every execution result and update the history archive to show full pipeline traces.
> 4. **Reliability:** Refactor the workflow engine to handle rate-limiting. If Gemini/HF returns a 429, the system must trigger a high-fidelity 'Mock Fallback' without failing the user's overall workflow.
> 5. **Documentation Overhaul:** Re-write the README, AI Notes, and Deployment guides to reflect this high-end technical reboot."
